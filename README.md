## Raw data

To make it simple, <code>.csv</code> is the only valid format for data input. The sample data file is generated using **Applied Biosystems ViiA 7**. Should there be other systems being used, make sure the columns for ***experimental groups***, ***genes of interest***, as well as ***cycle threshold (ct) values*** are labeled as ***"Sample Name"***, ***"Target Name"***, and ***"CT"***, respectively.
